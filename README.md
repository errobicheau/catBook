# CatBook - Social Media... for Cats
CatBook is a trendy full-stack platform resembling a social network for cat owners, serving as a feline-friendly counterpart to a popular social media app.

## How It's Made:

CatBook is built on the Node.js engine with the Express.js framework. CatBook follows typical MVC structure for routing and displaying requests. MongoDB serves as the database for CatBook, receiving, storing, and sending data regarding cat posts. On the front end, CatBook uses EJS as a view engine to provide flexible rendering of new posts. Other tools include BootStrap for styling, Passport.js for local authentication, and Multer for file (photo) upload.

## Optimizations & Roadmap

#### Optimizations
CatBook is capable of handling create, read, upload, and delete actions from users. Built with Node, the back end of this app runs fantastically. To optimize CatBook in the future, I would look to utilize a more advanced front end framework, such as React.js, to dynamically receive and render data to the user.

#### Roadmap
While CatBook is complete in a CRUD sense, there are a number of additional features that could be added to further develop the use of CatBook as a sophisticated social media platform. This includes:

- Add 'Likes' feature for unique posts.
- Add 'Comment' or 'Discussion' like feature for unique posts.
- Add user profiles allowing users to view their posts, customize their information, etc.
- Add ability to follow/have following users && ability to filter feed by following

## Lessons Learned:

CatBook was a joy to create. I was challenged with dynamically rendering data in the form of a feed while simultaneously having user authentication with 'unique permissions' to allow users to curate their own posts. CatBook provided a number of smaller, unique challenges as well including: file upload through Multer, data formatting and display, and user modeling.
